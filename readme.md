## SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND RESEARCHER (sergiosvieira@gmail.com)

I always enjoyed the idea of making a computer do what I want. My first programming experience was when I had twelve years old with my old computer TK3000II. Since that, I never stopped to
programming, and nowadays I still have fun learning new programming languages and improving my programming skills. 

During my academic period I've acquired experience in Research and Development mainly using a software called Network Simulator versions 2 and 3, and during my professional experience I've learned how to design a software architecture that is easy to maintain and how to work with a team. I love designing a solution and making it a reality.

### Professional Work Experience
#### COMPUTER SCIENCE PROFESSOR, FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CEARA
2019 - Current Job

#### SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, TECHNICAL LEAD FOR FUNCEME (WWW.FUNCEME.BR),
2014-2019

I brought to FUNCEME the culture of to working with version control software Git, and in this way,
a several different projects could be easy managed. I work a lot with modern C++17 programming
language using wxWidget in Windows Platform (Visual Studio). I was responsible for improving the
user experience using hydrologic network simulator called SIGA (http://www.funceme.br/siga/),
using computer graphics concepts. In this way, it was possible to load and simulate a huge
hydrological system. I worked with GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) library to improve a
method used to calculate the rainfall average in a Basin (Thiessen Method). I worked a lot with
CMake to create a multi-platform version of SIGA. I was responsible for creating a linear
programming model (GLPK) to simulates a priority network flow. All of this changes improved the
overall performance of SIGA and today, it is used by a main government institution of water
allocation resources in Brazil (ANA), to help the decision-making process on water allocation.

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, SVN, C++, QT5, WXWIDGETS, CMAKE, LINUX,
WINDOWS, MAC OSX, VISUAL STUDIO, GDAL, GLPK, TECHNICAL LEAD.**

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR WEELO
2012-2014

I worked in a Kickstarter called Weelo. I was the main iOS developer and I was responsible for
developing a chat app from scratch using Objective-C and the XMPP Protocol in Apple's
Development Platform (Xcode). I worked with many frameworks to bring to the app a lot of features
like Google maps localization, Facebook login for news users, customized XMPP Protocol and
Asynchronous Programming to upload images to Amazon S3 service.

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR FUJITEC
2012

I worked with the Python programming language and the Django framework. I worked in a team to
creating a financial web software. I created web services capable of reading local databases and
response queries. I also used CrediCard API to make financial transactions.

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, SVN, LINUX, PYTHON, DJANGO, WEB
DEVELOPMENT, VISA/MASTERCARD API.**

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR STATE UNIVERSITY OF CEARA (UECE)
2011-2012

I worked with the Ruby and the Racket Framework. In this project, I was responsible for creating
Network packets to be used in automatic network switch tests. I was also responsible for making
some improvements to the Ruby Garbage Collector using C language.

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, RUBY, C, LINUX, NETWORK, RUBY
GARBAGE COLLECTOR, OSPF, BGP, MPLS, RSVP.**

### Academic Experience
#### MASTER'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (STATE UNIVERSITY OF CEARA, FORTALEZA, BRAZIL)
2010-2012

My master's degree was mainly focused in Computer Networks. The field of study was related with
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET), Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and Fuzzy Logic. In my
thesis, I created a new VANET/DTN Network protocol using Fuzzy Logic on Network Simulator 3
(C++). I got good experimental results, as you can see on this paper AICT 2013 (https://goo.gl/iLUs4x)

**SKILLS: GIT, C++, SUMO, NETWORK SIMULATOR 3, LINUX, AWK, GNUPLOT, VANET, DTN,
NETWORK.**

#### BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (STATE UNIVERSITY OF CEARA, FORTALEZA, BRAZIL)
2005-2009

I began to work with network R&D since my second period at the University. I worked with MPLS
Diffserv, GMPLS and VANET. I participated in a research project responsible for creating protection
schemes on dense optical networks using metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithm). My thesis was
related to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks where I created a Driver Assistance System using Network
Simulator 2, as you can see at https://goo.gl/iLUs4x.

**SKILLS: MPLS, GMPLS, LINUX, AWK, VANET, NETWORK SIMULATOR 2, GNU PLOT, NETWORK**
