## SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND RESEARCHER (sergiosvieira@gmail.com)

I always enjoyed the idea of making a computer do what I want. My first programming experience was when I was twelve years old with my old computer TK3000II. Since then, I never stopped programming, and nowadays I still have fun learning new programming languages and improving my programming skills. 

When I was at university I acquired experience in Research and Development, and when I started to work as software engineer I learned how to design a maintanable software and how to work in a team. I love coming up with a solution and making it a reality.

#### SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, TECHNICAL LEAD FOR FUNCEME (WWW.FUNCEME.BR),
2014-2019

I brought to FUNCEME the culture of working with version control software (Git), so,
a several different projects could be easily managed. I worked a lot with modern C++17 programming
language using wxWidget in Windows Platform System (Visual Studio), QT5 in Mac OS X Platform System and 
I was responsible for improving the user experience and performance of SIGA (Hydrologic Network Simulator System) (http://www.funceme.br/siga/). I worked with GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) library to improve a
method used to calculates the rainfall average in a Basin (Thiessen Method). I created cmake files to provides
a multi-platform version of SIGA and I was the main responsible for creating a linear programming model using GLPK to simulates 
a priority network flow. All of these changes improved the overall performance of SIGA and today, it is used to help the decision-making process on water allocation by a main government institution of water allocation resources in Brazil (ANA).

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, SVN, C++, QT5, WXWIDGETS, CMAKE, LINUX,
WINDOWS, MAC OSX, VISUAL STUDIO, GDAL, GLPK, TECHNICAL LEAD.**

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR WEELO
2012-2014

I worked in a Kickstarter called Weelo. I was the main iOS developer and I was responsible for
developing a chat app from scratch using Objective-C and the XMPP Protocol in Apple's
Development Platform (Xcode). I worked with many frameworks to give the app a lot of features
like Google maps localization, Facebook login for news users, customized XMPP Protocol and
Asynchronous Programming to upload images to Amazon S3 service.

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, OBJECTIVE-C, XCODE, IOS 6 AND 7, MAC

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR FUJITEC
2012

I worked with Python programming language and Django framework. I worked in a team to
creating a financial web software. I created web services for reading local databases and
response queries. I also helped to create a CrediCard API to make financial transactions.

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, SVN, LINUX, PYTHON, DJANGO, WEB
DEVELOPMENT, VISA/MASTERCARD API.**

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR STATE UNIVERSITY OF CEARA (UECE)
2011-2012

I worked with Ruby and the Racket Framework. In this project, I was responsible for creating
network packets to be used in automatic network switch tests. I was also responsible for making
some improvements to the Ruby Garbage Collector using C language.

**SKILLS: SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, GIT, RUBY, C, LINUX, NETWORK, RUBY
GARBAGE COLLECTOR, OSPF, BGP, MPLS, RSVP.**

### Academic Experience
#### MASTER'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (STATE UNIVERSITY OF CEARA, FORTALEZA, BRAZIL)
2010-2012

My master's degree mainly focused in Computer Networks. The field of study was related with
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET), Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and Fuzzy Logic. In my
thesis, I created a new VANET/DTN Network protocol using Fuzzy Logic on Network Simulator 3
(C++). I got good experimental results as you can see on this paper AICT 2013 (https://goo.gl/iLUs4x)

**SKILLS: GIT, C++, SUMO, NETWORK SIMULATOR 3, LINUX, AWK, GNUPLOT, VANET, DTN,
NETWORK.**

#### BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (STATE UNIVERSITY OF CEARA, FORTALEZA, BRAZIL)
2005-2009

I began to work with network R&D in the second semester of my first year at University. I worked with MPLS
Diffserv, GMPLS and VANET. I was in a research project for creating protection
schemes on dense optical networks using metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithm). My thesis was
related to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks where I created a Driver Assistance System using Network
Simulator 2 as you can see at https://goo.gl/iLUs4x.

**SKILLS: MPLS, GMPLS, LINUX, AWK, VANET, NETWORK SIMULATOR 2, GNU PLOT, NETWORK**
